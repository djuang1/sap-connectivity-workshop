MuleSoft SAP Connectivity Workshop
===================

##Summary
The SAP Connectivity Technical Workshop is a self-paced online workshop designed for MuleSoft partners interested in using MuleSoft as part of their SAP integration projects. This workshop consists of a series of hands-on labs exposing participants to MuleSoft’s SAP integration solutions.

Lab solutions for the MuleSoft / SAP Connectivity Technical Workshop Labs are contained in this GitHub.

Important Note: This workshop requires the use of your own SAP instance to complete the lab. We are unable to provide an instance due to cost and complexity. If you don't have an SAP instance, you can leverage hosted SAP solutions that are provided for training. For the purpose of this lab, we used SandboxSAP which provides a cost-effective solution with an option of $30/month/user or $13.50/week/user.

##Duration
Self-Paced

##Description
MuleSoft’s top pre-sales technical experts will teach participants how to use the leverage our connectivity solution with SAP.

In the workshop, participants will:

1. Learn how to use the SAP Connector as an IDoc Inbound Endpoint within your flow. The project, once deployed, will serve as a JCo Server and listen for an IDoc of type DEBMAS. Once it receives the IDoc, it will output the content to a file on your local machine.
2. Learn how to use the SAP Connector as a Function Outbound Endpoint. The flow that you create will call a BAPI on your SAP server to retrieve a list of customers.
3. Learn how to use the SAP Connector as an IDoc Outbound Endpoint. The flow that you create will send an IDoc to SAP to create a customer record.
